How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent around 6 to 7 hours in this project

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge was to get the error classes to display the error
message. I had to do a lot of googleling and read a couple of tutorial to understand
what was it that I wanted to do.

What two additional features did you build? Why?
1.- I added a way to identify a customer by id instead of name, since they might be
customer with the same name.
2.- I also added the ability to write a report to a file of all the transactions.
Just in case the boss wanted a print copy of them.

Where do you still have room to grow?
I feel I can do better on generating the errors and doing exceptions.
